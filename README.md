# Water-Managment
A repository is a centralized space where all the files, code, and resources for a project are stored and organized. It allows for easy management of versions, tracking of changes, and collaboration on the project. For the Water Management project, the repository contains the SQL database, Java code, and user interface, using simulated data.
